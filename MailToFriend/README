blurt 1.0 MailToFriend.pm
===========================

A plugin for blurt 1.0 that allows visitors to your site to send
the contents of your posts to their friends via email.

By Matthijs de Jonge (rhmtts@gmail.com).

This software is public domain software: do with it whatever you want.


INSTALL:
========

- Take a look at MailToFriend.pm in the plugins subdirectory of this package
  Fill in the host name of your mail server, the email address of the web
  master, the host name of the web server and change the footer text and the
  status message to something nice 

- Change the templates in the templates subdirectory of this package to suit your needs.
  You'll probably want to keep the JavaScript - it makes sure people don't go
  around sending empty forms.

- Upload MailToFriend.pm to the plugins directory on your web server and 
  upload the .mailtofriend templates to the templates directory on your web server.

NOTES:
======

- You'll need access to a mail server for MailToFriend to work. If you don't know 
  if you have such a thing or if you don't know the host name of the mail server you
  can use, contact your web host. If the mail server isn't located on the same machine
  as your web server, you'll need to make sure that the mail server is willing to "relay"
  mail for your web server (again, if you're not sure about this, contact your web host).

- It's imperative that you enter a *valid* email address for the web master (the OurEmail 
  field in MailToFriend.pm). If you don't, your mail server will refuse to send out email
  messages for you.

- The plugin will not let you know if the mail server refused to send the message for some
  reason. Test it by sending yourself a few messages.

- The plugin does very little to prevent spammers from using your site to send out their 
  unsollicited garbage. What it does do is check if it's called from somewhere within
  your site (HTTP_REFERER must match $BlogPath). It also makes sure to only send out email when there
  is in fact a title and a post to send. What this means is that a spammer must at least invest 
  a little effort before he can send out spam messages using your MailToFriend plugin. As long
  as very few people actually use blurt, that is probably a waste of time to him. However, if you find 
  your site does get targeted by spammers, send me an email (rhmtts@gmail.com) and I'll look
  into the matter as soon as possible.


VARIABLES:
==========

The MailToFriend plugin supplies the following variables for use in all
templates:

$MailToFriend::StatusMessage : a message that gets shown if email has been sent

It's empty if not applicable.
