blurt 1.0 Comments.pm
=====================

A plugin for blurt 1.0 that enables vistors to leave comments. 

By Matthijs de Jonge (rhmtts@gmail.com).

This software is public domain software: do with it whatever you want.


INSTALL:
========

- Create a new directory comments in de directory where you keep your
  blurt installation on your web server. Make sure it's world writable
  (chmod 777)

- Edit head.comments, foot.comments and story.comments and upload them
  to the template directory on your server

- Edit some variables in Comments.pm : tell it the path to your
  comments directory and the number of days you want to allow people
  to attach comments to a post after it's been written

- Upload Comments.pm to the plugins directory of your blurt
  installation on the server

VARIABLES:
==========

The comments plugin supplies the following variables for use in all
story templates:

$Comments::count   : the number of comments attached to a given post


The comments plugin also supplies the following variables for use in
the story.comment template:

$Comments::display   : display all comments
$Comments::form      : display a form with which users can upload
their comment. This variable is only filled if the current post is
less than a given number of days old.


USE:
====

One of my pet peeves with other blog software is that it allows users
to comment on posts that are so old you've pretty much forgotten about
them. Especially since it's usually spammers that do this. The
comments plugin only allows comments to posts that are less than a
given number of days old (modify Comments.pm to set this number - by
default it's thirty). Of course if you want to, you can allow comments
to all posts: simply set this number really high.
