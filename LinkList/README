===========================

A plugin for blurt 1.0 that displays a list of links in head and foot
templates.

This software is public domain software: do with it whatever you want.


INSTALL:
========

- Modify LinkList.txt to contain the links you want to show. Empty
  lines in LinkList.txt are ignored, as are lines beginning with #
  (meaning you can have comments in your LinkList.txt)

  Link entries in LinkList.txt consist of the title, a semicolon
  and the URL, eg:

  blurt;http://blurt.rommelhok.com

- Modify LinkList.pm to let it know where it can find your LinkList.txt

- If you want, you can change what LinkList.pm shows before and after
  the link list, before and after each link and before and after each
  link title

- By default LinkList.pm shuffles your list of links. If you don't
  want it to do that, set the value of $ShuffleList in the LinkList.pm
  configuration section to 0

- Upload LinkList.pm to the plugins directory of your blurt
  installation on the server and LinkList.txt to whereever you want
  to store it.

VARIABLES:
==========

$LinkList::LinkList : the html code for your link list
